TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC (Keep this in Zoph):
Whelp, despite the fact that Zophar hates me, I've 
decided to contribute to his little archive, make it 
a bit bigger.  After hours of work, I finished Contra
4, The Hard Corps, in about 45 minutes.  Errrr, that 
doesn't sound right, but it is.  Anyways, shame on you
for downloading this.  The game's fun, play it through
to the end.  If you can't finish it quicker than me, 
you're a girly man.  So have fun and enjoy.

DESCRIPTION OF SAVE:
Well, I just blew up the big purple multi-headed 
biological freak, which I should call "Humanly 
Challenged", or else Zophar will get all over my ass
again about racism, and I'm sitting here on a rocket.
Just sit back and relax, and you'll see the nice pretty
ending in flourishing Japanese.
